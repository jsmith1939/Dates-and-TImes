# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Dates and Times

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection** (and the **Project Plan** if you complete the Advanced Level), but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Running the Unit Tests (Basic and Intermediate Levels Only)

_(Instructions for how to install the unit testing framework and run the unit tests.)_

## Project Plan (Advanced Level Only)

_(Put your project plan here. It could be pseudocode, an outline-style development plan, etc. But whatever form you choose, it should be detailed enough that another developer could feasibly use it to implement your solution.)_
 

 I just tried to do exactly what the direction ask me to based on how I understood. For example it says get todays date, i'll create variable that will say let day = day.getDay(). Although I didn't get it exactly right. It was a lot of trial error. I also used mdn and use their example On how they used the new Date function and understand how it works.
## Reflection

### Basic and Intermediate Levels Only

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

Unit test allows you to test you code to see if it works, drawbacks its annoying

### Advanced Level Only

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

I try doing designing the stop watch first bc I new it was one of the most tedious thing to do.
Then I had to get help understand how the set interval and work and how to execute it correctly.

I dont believe there is any advantages or disadvantages of the approaches I have taken bc both require time.
